A particularly exciting frontier is the automation of AI research experimentation‚Äîthe process of designing, executing, and analyzing experiments to advance AI itself. Unlike fields requiring physical experimentation, AI research is largely digital‚Äîwell-suited for LLM-based automation. Ideally, we want to provide an AI agent with a research goal‚Äîsuch as reproducing a result, validating a new hypothesis, or testing an ablation‚Äî along with the specific context and have the agent: Formulate hypotheses, design experiments, Interpret the associated codebase and identify how to modify it, Configure and execute experiments under the right conditions, Analyze results and iteratively refine its approach based on findings Figure 1. EXP-Bench evaluates AI agents on research experiment tasks extracted semi-autonomously from peer-reviewed AI papers. Achieving this vision requires benchmarks that evaluate agents in real-world research scenarios. But how do we define those scenarios in a way that‚Äôs representative, reproducible, and gradable? Intuitively, peer-reviewed AI papers (e.g., in NeurIPS) along with their open-source codebases, offer a rich source of completed experiments that could, in theory, be repurposed to evaluate AI capabilities in research automation. In practice, however, extracting these tasks is difficult. Papers often present a polished narrative that omits intermediate steps, while critical details‚Äîsuch as the precise conditions under which results hold‚Äîare scattered across dense text, supplementary materials, and sprawling repositories. Our Contribution: EXP-Bench To address this challenge, we introduce EXP-Bench, a new benchmark designed to make the ever-expanding landscape of published research more accessible for evaluating AI agents in conducting end-to-end research experiments‚Äîfrom hypothesis to experimental setup to conclusion, as shown in Figure 1. We develop a semi-automated pipeline that uses multimodal and agentic approaches to reconstruct experiments from fragmented and dense sources (e.g., coding agents identify setups by conditioning on ground-truth outcomes and leveraging the full codebase‚Äîreducing the task to a constrained search), while interleaving these steps with lightweight human validation to ensure correctness. Using this approach, we distilled 461 experiments from NeurIPS and ICLR papers‚Äîspanning domains such as vision, RL, and computational biology‚Äîresulting in over 12,000 gradable subtasks. Figure 2. Our semi-automated pipeline for constructing EXP-Bench from published papers. What EXP-Bench Reveals About Today‚Äôs AI Agents We tested leading agents, including OpenHands w/ Claude Sonnet 3.7, and found that while they can earn partial credit for individual steps like experiment design or coding (~20-35% success), their ability to complete a full, executable experiment is nearly non-existent‚Äîa mere 0.5% success rate. Our analysis pinpointed several critical weaknesses: Limited Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning Inability to Handle Open-Ended and Ambiguous Tasks Difficulty with Code Execution and Debugging These results highlight just how far we still are from our goal of automation of research experimentation. By identifying these bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures, EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability to conduct AI research experiments. Looking Forward This work is, we hope, a small step toward our broader goal of designing agents capable of automating scientific research. We see EXP-Bench as a launchpad for the next wave of AI research copilots. That said, much work remains. While EXP-Bench currently focuses on machine learning papers, it does not yet address domains that require interaction with the physical world or support tasks involving true scientific invention. Expanding to those areas‚Äîand capturing the creativity, uncertainty, and iteration of real-world discovery‚Äîremains an open and exciting challenge.

    "body": "The AI Co-Scientist Making ML More Accessible for Your Research üíª Github Link | üìí Use Cases | üìÑ Paper Link In our previous post, we introduced Curie: an open-sourced AI co-scientist that automates experimentation and accelerate the journey from idea to validation. Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to introduce Curie‚Äôs AutoML feature, designed to help researchers rapidly test hypotheses and unlock insights from their valuable data. We built this AutoML feature after personally seeing how even highly-capable researchers‚Äîin fields like biology, materials science, and chemistry‚Äîstruggle to apply machine learning to their work. They often have valuable data, but lack the advanced ML knowledge to fully explore its potential. Despite their expertise, the technical barriers make ML feel out of reach, and this is the exact problem that we wanted to solve. Curie can create end-to-end machine learning solutions for non-ML experts, and we have evidence of it already making a positive impact with our early adopters. Introducing Curie‚Äôs New Feature: Your Automated ML Solution Curie goes beyond traditional parameter or architecture search based AutoML, and takes over all the tedious but critical work performed by ML practitioners. From data preprocessing, to model and hyperparameter selection, to training and deploying recipes, which all require deep expertise. It‚Äôs a vast search space to find the best performing solution, often involving iterative experiments and specialized intuition to fine-tune all the different components in the pipeline. Curie aims to automate this. The goal is to democratize access to powerful ML capabilities for researchers. Curie AutoML Overview All you need to do is input your research question and the dataset path to Curie (more details here): import curie result = curie.experiment( api_keys=key_dict, question=\"E.g. How to improve my prediction accuracy on my dataset. Checkout &lt;paper.pdf&gt; for the more information.\", workspace_name=\"[Optional] /path/to/your/code\", dataset_dir=\"/path/to/your/dataset\" ) From there, it will work to generate the optimal ML solution for your specific problem given the budget. Curie in Action: Demonstrated Performance We‚Äôve benchmarked Curie on several ML tasks‚Äîincluding several from MLE-Bench‚Äîto demonstrate its capabilities: Identifying Melanoma (Cancer) in Images of Skin Lesions Predict the severity level of diabetic retinopathy based on retinal images Histopathologic Cancer Detection Stock Price Prediction More AutoML use cases can be found here. Case Study: Skin Cancer Detection Challenge Here‚Äôs a preview of an auto-generated report from Curie. You can scroll through it to see the detailed analysis and insights: Curie demonstrated some impressive capabilities in the skin cancer detection challenge: It managed to train a model achieving a remarkable 0.99 AUC (top 1% performance) using 2 hours. Moreover, the agent intelligently explored a variety of models with early stopping strategies on dataset subsets to quickly gauge potential to efficiently navigate the vast search space of possible models. It incorporated data augmentation (random rotation, color jitter, ‚Ä¶) to enhance model generalization. It provided detailed analysis on performance versus system trade-offs, offering insights for efficient model deployment strategies. Despite the strong performance, there are areas where Curie can evolve. The current model architectures explored were relatively basic, and the specific ML problem, while important, is a well-established one. It‚Äôs possible the task wasn‚Äôt as challenging as some newer, more complex problems. The true test will be its performance on more diverse, real-world datasets. Looking ahead, a crucial area for improvement lies in enhancing the agent‚Äôs hypothesis generation capabilities. We‚Äôre keen to see it explore the search space beyond established empirical knowledge, which will be key to unlocking even higher levels of accuracy and tackling more novel challenges.
